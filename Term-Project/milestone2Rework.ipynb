Additionally, I don't think there are ethical implications of removing songs with a popularity score of 0.  I think if I had gone with my initial plan of less than than 50 there could be some potential ethical issues. Data wrangling in general can have the ethical implication of adding bias when removing data, however, I believe I have navigated this as best I can while cleaning the data."
